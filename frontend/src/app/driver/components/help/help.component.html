  <h5>How do I request roadside assistance?</h5>

  <p>
    To request assistance for your vehicle, press the grey 'Send Help Request' button that can be
    found on the landing page right after the login. The app will immediately transmit your vehicle's
    diagnostic data to our servers and an assistance operator will take care of your problem.
  </p><br>

  <h5>How can I see what the problem with my vehicle is?</h5>
  <p>
    If you want to know what is wrong with your car, click on the vehicle in the carousel on the
    landing page. You will immediately get directed to an analysis view with an 3D visualization of
    the issue. Furthermore, you will find an explanation for the check control signs.

  <h5>What do I need to do after having sent a help request?</h5>
  <p>
    Our application is designed to simplify the process of requesting roadside assistance. Therefore,
    you do not have to explain what is wrong with your vehicle or where you are. The system automatically
    requests the needed data from our partner and transmits it to the roadside assistance
    company.

  <h5>I have installed the app but I can not request roadside assistance?</h5>
  <p>
    In order to be able to use this function, you will need to subscribe to the Roadside Assistance
    flat rate from our partner 'Roadside Assistance Club'.
